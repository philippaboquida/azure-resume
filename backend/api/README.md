# Your API lives here

Python based API binded to CosmosDB to trigger Azure Functions

**Python Code**
Since my goal with this is to learn Azure itself, rather than coding, I used ChatGPT prompts to create the python code here to count visitors
This does not align with the guide video I used, as that was using C#.

I did not at first understand why the application was not working, after creating the backend using VS Code, it did not drop the python script and function.json into an appropriate directory. Using Microsoft documentation, I eventually discovered this issue and was able to load locally the application to my web browser.
